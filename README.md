## A brief note on issues and branches

In order to keep us organized, we're going to rely heavily on Github built-in functionalty, specifically ISSUES and BRANCHES. 

Every time you go to work on an app feature, you should be working on a different branch that will be rolled into master once completed. 

Each branch should include the name of the issue that it is attempting to satisfy. For example, if issue `#3` relates to creating small multiple charts, your branch name should be something like `3-small-multi`. This way, we can keep track of exactly what branches are supposed to be doing.

If you are working on something that does not yet have an issue, please create an issue so we can track our progress.
